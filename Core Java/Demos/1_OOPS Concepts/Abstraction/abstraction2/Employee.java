/*
 * ABSTRACT CLASS: 
 * Abstract classes cannot be instantiated.
 * All other functionalities like member, methods and constructors still exist and function in same
 * manner. Only difference between regular class and abstract class is that it cannot be instantiated.
 * So that essentially means that their existence is worth less as we cannot create any object.
 * There is one way in which these can be used, by inheriting them. This is just to help a design where
 * a class needs to be created but never instantiated. 
 * 
 * If a method is declared as abstract in this class,
 * any class extending this will have to implement it.
 * Infact, if a method in a class is declared as abstract:
 * 1. class must also be abstract
 * 2. there should be no definition of the class
 * 
 * APPLICATION / USAGE:
 * 1. When you have a requirement where your base class should provide default 
 * implementation of certain methods whereas other methods should be open to 
 * being overridden by child classes use abstract classes.
 * 2. The purpose of an abstract class is to provide a common definition of a 
 * base class that multiple derived classes can share.
 * 3. When creating a class library which will be widely distributed or reused?
 * especially to clients, use an abstract class in preference to an interface;
 * because, it simplifies versioning.
